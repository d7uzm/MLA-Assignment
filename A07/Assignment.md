### Responses

#### How can machine learning support people's existing creative practices? Expand people's creative capabilities?

I am uncertain if this was directly said in the video itself, but I think that one of the best things machine learning can do for creative practices is that it allows intuitive interactions. It enables the potential where the instruments adapt to us instead of us adapting to them. We now have the power to choose how we map the input to certain outputs. I believe this is very different from traditional arts where we had smaller window of input and smaller combinations of output.

It enables the possibility of instruments adapting to us, rather than us adapting to them. We now possess the power to decide how we map inputs to specific outputs. I think this contrasts with traditional arts, where we had a narrower range of inputs and fewer combinations of outputs.

#### Dream up and design the inputs and outputs of a real-time machine learning system for interaction and audio/visual performance. This could be an idea well beyond the scope of what you can do in a weekly exercise.

While it may not be for public performances, I believe it would be nice to have a background music generator connected to biomarkers such as heartbeat, hormone levels, and so on. It could find music with a matching beat, or it could be used to regulate mood.


### Code Practice

This time, I did not have much interesting idea. Many of them were simply too simple, or it was too complex to implement. After exploring for days, I finally had an idea of creating a regression model on predicting some points. To be specific, I wanted to reuse my [Puppet Swim](https://editor.p5js.org/ob2sd/sketches/GoGZL0eJh) code and have a sketch that based on time, the user and the neural network take turn to control the puppet (more like NN mimicking the user). However, after trying my best of my ability to implement the idea, I realized that I could not implement the function myself. So I scrapped it. 

Since I did not have enough time to think of new idea, I will just implement the time-based recording in a sketch.

This time, I did not have many interesting ideas. Many were either too simple or too complex to implement. After days of exploration, I finally had an idea of creating a regression model to predict certain points. Specifically, I wanted to repurpose my [Puppet Swim](https://editor.p5js.org/ob2sd/sketches/GoGZL0eJh) code and design a sketch where, based on time, both the user and the neural network take turns to control the puppet (with the NN essentially mimicking the user). However, despite my best efforts, I realized I could not implement this feature myself, so I discarded it.

Since I lacked the time to come up with a new idea, I decided to simply implement the time-based recording in a sketch.
